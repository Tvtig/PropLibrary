# PropLibrary
This is a library of props that you might find useful on your game development journey.

I make short videos showing how I made each of the props, you can find them on my YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/tvtig

So far this library consists of the following props:

01 - BasicBarel (https://youtu.be/SsUr6J4bcaQ)
